- **Interleaving** ‚Üí mix multiple domains daily to prevent shallow learning
- **Feynman Technique** ‚Üí explain each concept in simple terms as if teaching a beginner
- **Active Recall** ‚Üí daily questions + end-of-day **very hard scenario challenges**

## üìÖ Week 1 ‚Äì Cluster Hardening & Core Security Concepts

### Day 1 ‚Äì Kubernetes Security Fundamentals + API Access
- Topics:
  - Kubernetes attack surface
  - Authentication & Authorization (RBAC, ABAC, Webhook auth)
  - ServiceAccounts & default permissions
- Active Recall Questions:
  - What is the difference between RBAC and ABAC in Kubernetes?
  - Why are default ServiceAccounts a risk?
  - How does Kubernetes API handle authentication internally?
- Very Hard Challenge:
  - A cluster has 200 namespaces, each with workloads using the default ServiceAccount.  
    How would you **audit, detect, and mitigate privilege escalation** across all namespaces  
    without downtime, and enforce it as a **policy**?

### Day 2 ‚Äì Pod Security + Workload Restrictions
- Topics:
  - SecurityContext (runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFS, capabilities)
  - PodSecurity admission (restricted/baseline/privileged)
  - AppArmor, seccomp
- Active Recall:
  - What does `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` actually prevent?
  - Why is `readOnlyRootFilesystem` critical?
  - How to enforce `runAsNonRoot` across all workloads?
- Very Hard Challenge:
  - A malicious pod is deployed with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. It spawns privileged containers across namespaces.  
    How do you **trace the source**, enforce prevention cluster-wide, and ensure **zero false positives**  
    while allowing necessary workloads?

- Very Hard Challenge:
  - Your microservices-based app has **200+ services**. Some need **east-west traffic** open,  
    others require strict isolation. Design a **scalable NetworkPolicy framework**  
    without breaking production traffic, and explain how you would **validate it dynamically**.
