# üõ°Ô∏è CKS 30-Day Neuro-Optimized Study Blueprint

This plan applies **spaced repetition, interleaving, active recall, and the Feynman technique** to help you master Kubernetes security in 30 days.  
You already know CKA, so this focuses on **security mastery**.

---

## üìÖ Weekly Plan Overview
- **Week 1:** Core Security Fundamentals (RBAC, Pod Security, Network, Images, Runtime)  
- **Week 2:** Policy & Data Security (Admission, OPA, Secrets, TLS, Service Mesh)  
- **Week 3:** Attack/Defense (Privilege Escalation, Escapes, Audit Logs, IR)  
- **Week 4:** Mastery & Exam Prep (Speed drills, Reviews, Mock Exams)

## üîë Tools & Methods
- **Spaced Repetition** ‚Üí Use Anki for RBAC verbs, PSA levels, NetPol rules.  
- **Interleaving** ‚Üí Always mix 2 domains (e.g., Admission + Secrets, Network + Runtime).  
- **Feynman Notebook** ‚Üí Explain every topic in your own words daily.  
- **Active Recall** ‚Üí Self-quiz with the provided questions.  
- **Mocks** ‚Üí Use [Killer.sh CKS](https://killer.sh) and practice clusters.
