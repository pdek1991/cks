1️⃣ Fundamentals of Kubernetes Network Policies

What are Network Policies?

How Kubernetes controls network traffic at the pod level

Role of CNI (Container Network Interface) in enforcing NSPs

Supported CNIs: Calico, Cilium, Weave (Flannel does NOT support NSPs)

Default behavior of Kubernetes networking (All traffic is allowed unless restricted by NSPs)

2️⃣ Network Policy Components & YAML Structure

podSelector (Which pods the policy applies to)

ingress (Defines allowed incoming traffic)

egress (Defines allowed outgoing traffic)

policyTypes (Specifies ingress, egress, or both)

Label-based traffic control

3️⃣ Ingress Network Policies (Restrict Incoming Traffic)

Creating a Deny-All Ingress policy

Allowing ingress from specific pods

Allowing traffic only from a particular namespace

Combining multiple ingress rules

4️⃣ Egress Network Policies (Restrict Outgoing Traffic)

Creating a Deny-All Egress policy

Allowing only specific external traffic (e.g., DNS, API, DBs)

Namespace-based egress restrictions

5️⃣ Advanced Use Cases & Scenarios

Namespace isolation using NSPs

Multi-tier application security (frontend, backend, database)

Restricting pod-to-pod communication across namespaces

Implementing Zero Trust networking in Kubernetes

6️⃣ Debugging & Troubleshooting Network Policies

Using kubectl describe networkpolicy

Checking applied policies with kubectl get networkpolicy

Testing pod connectivity using kubectl exec + curl/wget/ping

Debugging tools for different CNIs:

calicoctl for Calico

cilium monitor for Cilium

Common mistakes and misconfigurations


## 🔹 General Best Practices  

✅ Default Deny-All Policy – Start with a **deny-all** rule and explicitly allow only necessary traffic.  

✅ Least Privilege Model (Zero Trust) – Only allow traffic that is explicitly required.  

✅ Apply Namespace-Based Isolation – Use policies to prevent pods in one namespace from communicating with others.  

✅ Use Labels Effectively – Define pod selectors carefully to apply policies only where needed.  

✅ Minimize Wildcard Usage (`{}`) – Avoid broad, unrestricted network policies.  

---  

## 🔹 Ingress Best Practices  

✅ Block All Unnecessary Ingress Traffic – Use a **deny-all ingress** policy as a starting point.  

✅ Allow Traffic Only from Trusted Pods – Specify **podSelector** rules instead of allowing all traffic.  

✅ Use Namespace Selectors – Restrict access from specific namespaces.  

✅ Limit External Exposure – Allow ingress traffic only from specific IP ranges when necessary.  



🔹 Egress Best Practices

✅ Restrict Outbound Traffic – Apply deny-all egress as a baseline.

✅ Allow Only Necessary External Traffic – Define egress policies to restrict external API/database access.

✅ Use DNS-Based Egress Filtering – Some CNIs (e.g., Cilium) support DNS-aware egress rules.

🔹 Advanced Best Practices

✅ Limit Cross-Namespace Communication – Use namespaceSelector to prevent unnecessary cross-namespace traffic.

✅ Implement Network Segmentation – Separate frontend, backend, and database layers.

✅ Regularly Audit Network Policies – Use tools like kubectl describe networkpolicy to check applied rules.

✅ Leverage CNI Features – Use Calico, Cilium, or Weave for advanced network security features.
