- Access to Secrets managed by the cluster. Care should be taken to only
  log Metadata for requests to Secrets, ConfigMaps, and TokenReviews, in
  order to avoid risk of logging sensitive data.
- Modification of Pod and Deployment objects.
- Use of `pods/exec`, `pods/portforward`, `pods/proxy` and `services/proxy`.
For most requests, minimally logging at the Metadata level is recommended
(the most basic level of logging).

5.1.1 Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role : kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]
Condition: is_compliant is false if rolename is not cluster-admin and rolebinding is cluster-admin.

5.1.2 Where possible, remove get, list and watch access to Secret objects in the cluster.

5.1.3 Where possible replace any use of wildcards ["*"] in roles and clusterroles with specific
objects or actions.
Condition: role_is_compliant is false if ["*"] is found in rules.
Condition: clusterrole_is_compliant is false if ["*"] is found in rules.

5.1.4 Where possible, remove create access to pod objects in the cluster.

5.1.5 Create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access
to the Kubernetes API server.
Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value
`automountServiceAccountToken: false`.

5.1.6 Modify the definition of ServiceAccounts and Pods which do not need to mount service
account tokens to disable it, with `automountServiceAccountToken: false`.
If both the ServiceAccount and the Pod's .spec specify a value for automountServiceAccountToken, the Pod spec takes precedence.
Condition: Pod is_compliant to true when
  - ServiceAccount is automountServiceAccountToken: false and Pod is automountServiceAccountToken: false or notset
  - ServiceAccount is automountServiceAccountToken: true notset and Pod is automountServiceAccountToken: false

5.1.7 Remove the system:masters group from all users in the cluster.

5.1.8 Where possible, remove the impersonate, bind and escalate rights from subjects.

5.1.9 Where possible, remove create access to PersistentVolume objects in the cluster.

5.1.10 Where possible, remove access to the proxy sub-resource of node objects.

5.1.11 Where possible, remove access to the approval sub-resource of certificatesigningrequests objects.

5.1.12 Where possible, remove access to the validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations objects

5.1.13 Where possible, remove access to the token sub-resource of serviceaccount objects.

5.2.1 Ensure that either Pod Security Admission or an external policy control system is in place
for every namespace which contains user workloads.

5.2.2 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of privileged containers.
Audit: the audit list all pods' containers to retrieve their .securityContext.privileged value.
Condition: is_compliant is false if container's `.securityContext.privileged` is set to `true`.
Default: by default, there are no restrictions on the creation of privileged containers.

5.2.3 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of `hostPID` containers.
Audit: the audit retrieves each Pod' spec.hostPID.
Condition: is_compliant is false if Pod's spec.hostPID is set to `true`.
Default: by default, there are no restrictions on the creation of hostPID containers.

5.2.4 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of `hostIPC` containers.
Audit: the audit retrieves each Pod' spec.IPC.
Condition: is_compliant is false if Pod's spec.hostIPC is set to `true`.
Default: by default, there are no restrictions on the creation of hostIPC containers.

5.2.5 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of `hostNetwork` containers.
Audit: the audit retrieves each Pod' spec.hostNetwork.
Condition: is_compliant is false if Pod's spec.hostNetwork is set to `true`.
Default: by default, there are no restrictions on the creation of hostNetwork containers.

5.2.6 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers with `.securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `true`.
Audit: the audit retrieves each Pod's container(s) `.securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation`.
Condition: is_compliant is false if container's `.securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` is set to `true`.
Default: If notset, privilege escalation is allowed (default to true). However if PSP/PSA is used with a `restricted` profile,
privilege escalation is explicitly disallowed unless configured otherwise.

5.2.7 Create a policy for each namespace in the cluster, ensuring that either `MustRunAsNonRoot`
or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0, is set.

5.2.8 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers with the `NET_RAW` capability.

5.2.9 Ensure that `allowedCapabilities` is not present in policies for the cluster unless
it is set to an empty array.
Audit: the audit retrieves each Pod's container(s) added capabilities.
Condition: is_compliant is false if added capabilities are added for a given container.
Default: Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime.

5.2.10 Review the use of capabilites in applications running on your cluster. Where a namespace
contains applicaions which do not require any Linux capabities to operate consider adding
a PSP which forbids the admission of containers which do not drop all capabilities.

5.2.11 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers that have `.securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess` set to `true`.

5.2.12 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers with `hostPath` volumes.

5.2.13 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers which use `hostPort` sections.

5.3.1 If the CNI plugin in use does not support network policies, consideration should be given to
making use of a different plugin, or finding an alternate mechanism for restricting traffic
in the Kubernetes cluster.

5.3.2 Follow the documentation and create NetworkPolicy objects as you need them.

5.4.1 If possible, rewrite application code to read Secrets from mounted secret files, rather than
from environment variables.

5.4.2 Refer to the Secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party
secrets management solution.

5.5.1 Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup image provenance.

5.7.1 Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need
them.

5.7.2 Use `securityContext` to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions.
An example is as below:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault

5.7.3 Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply SecurityContexts to your Pods. For a
suggested list of SecurityContexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker
Containers.

5.7.4 Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes
resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.
