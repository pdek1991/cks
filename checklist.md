üìù Kubernetes Security & Architecture Mastery Checklist

A 30-day intensive checklist to build expertise equivalent to 10 years of experience in Kubernetes Security, Architecture, and Production Operations.

Each section has ‚úÖ checkboxes for tracking.

1. Core Kubernetes Security (CKS Domains)

Cluster Setup & Hardening

[ ] Restrict API server access with RBAC

[ ] Configure TLS certificates rotation

[ ] Restrict insecure ports (kubelet, etcd)

[ ] Enable PodSecurity admission / PSP alternatives (OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno)

[ ] Enforce CIS Kubernetes Benchmark

[ ] Implement Network Policies (deny-all default)

[ ] Protect etcd with authentication & encryption

[ ] Enable encryption at rest (secrets)

[ ] Restrict kubeconfig access (per-user credentials)

[ ] Implement API rate limiting & request validation


System Hardening

[ ] OS-level security patches

[ ] Minimize host attack surface

[ ] Disable unused kernel modules

[ ] Apply seccomp profiles

[ ] Apply AppArmor or SELinux policies

[ ] Harden container runtime (CRI-O / containerd)

[ ] Configure kernel sysctl parameters for networking


Minimize Microservice Vulnerabilities

[ ] Scan container images (Trivy, Anchore, Aqua)

[ ] Use distroless/minimal base images

[ ] Run containers as non-root

[ ] Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities

[ ] Set read-only root filesystem

[ ] Use securityContext (UID/GID, fsGroup, capabilities)

[ ] Restrict privilege escalation (allowPrivilegeEscalation: false)

[ ] Use admission controllers to enforce policies (OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno)


Supply Chain Security

[ ] Enable ImagePolicyWebhook or admission control

[ ] Sign images (Cosign, Notary, Sigstore)

[ ] Maintain private container registry

[ ] Validate manifests (kubeval, conftest, OPA)

[ ] Enforce IaC scanning (Terraform, Helm, Kustomize scanning)


Monitoring, Logging & Runtime Security

[ ] Enable cluster-wide logging (EFK, Loki)

[ ] Monitor node & pod metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)

[ ] Detect anomalies with Falco

[ ] Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity

[ ] Configure SIEM integration (ELK, Splunk)

[ ] Runtime policy enforcement (Falco, AppArmor, Seccomp)

[ ] Alerting & incident response workflow

2. Kubernetes Architecture & Operations

Cluster Architecture

[ ] Control Plane HA setup

[ ] Multi-master cluster with etcd quorum

[ ] Worker node pools for different workloads

[ ] Cluster Federation concepts

[ ] Hybrid cloud (on-prem + cloud clusters)


Networking & Ingress

[ ] CNI plugins (Calico, Cilium, Weave)

[ ] Configure Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

[ ] DNS in Kubernetes (CoreDNS, scaling, tuning)

[ ] Ingress controllers (NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy)

[ ] Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd) basics

[ ] Multi-tenancy isolation with namespaces + network policies


Storage & Databases

[ ] PV, PVC, StorageClasses

[ ] StatefulSets for DBs (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB)

[ ] Backup & restore strategies (Velero, Kasten)

[ ] Data encryption in-transit & at-rest

[ ] Multi-cloud database failover patterns


Observability & Reliability

[ ] Metrics collection (Prometheus Operator)

[ ] Distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)

[ ] Centralized logging

[ ] SLOs/SLIs for apps

[ ] Chaos testing (LitmusChaos)

[ ] Auto-healing deployments


CI/CD & GitOps

[ ] Secure pipeline (GitLab CI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

[ ] Image scanning in CI/CD

[ ] Policy-as-code in pipelines

[ ] Canary/Blue-Green deployments

[ ] Secret management (SealedSecrets, HashiCorp Vault, SOPS)

3. Supporting Knowledge

Cloud Infrastructure

[ ] Deploy K8s on AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), GCP (GKE)

[ ] Deploy K8s on bare-metal / on-prem (kubeadm, Rancher, OpenShift)

[ ] Hybrid cloud networking (VPN, DirectConnect)

[ ] Identity federation with cloud IAM + Kubernetes RBAC


Production-Grade Setup

[ ] Multi-cluster disaster recovery

[ ] Backup/restore for etcd

[ ] Upgrade strategy (control plane + nodes)

[ ] Rolling node replacements

[ ] Cost optimization strategies

[ ] SLA/SLO design


Advanced Security Integrations

[ ] LDAP/OIDC integration with Kubernetes

[ ] RBAC hierarchy for org-wide access

[ ] Multi-tenancy with strict isolation

[ ] Zero Trust networking with mTLS

[ ] API Gateway security

[ ] WAF integration

5. Mastery Validation (Hard Questions for Self-Test)

[ ] How would you design a multi-tenant production-grade Kubernetes cluster where workloads must not interfere with each other (CPU/memory/network isolation) while ensuring minimal admin overhead?

[ ] How would you secure the entire container lifecycle from developer commit ‚Üí CI/CD ‚Üí production deployment ‚Üí runtime monitoring?

[ ] Given a compromised pod with NET_ADMIN capability, explain attack paths to the API server and how to mitigate them.

[ ] How do you enforce supply chain security for 500 microservices deployed daily across hybrid clusters?

[ ] Your etcd is leaking secrets due to misconfigured encryption. How do you recover securely without downtime?

[ ] How would you design a multi-cloud failover for a stateful DB-backed app on Kubernetes while meeting RPO < 5 min and RTO < 15 min?

[ ] How would you build a zero-trust Kubernetes network with service mesh and strong workload identity?

‚úÖ By completing this checklist, you‚Äôll:

Be fully prepared for CKS Certification

Demonstrate 10+ years of production Kubernetes Security & Architecture expertise

Confidently handle day-1 responsibilities as a Kubernetes Security Architect



---

Do you want me to split this checklist into a 30-day progressive daily plan with interleaved practice tasks (so you tick sections per day), or keep it as one comprehensive checklist for you to self-pace?
