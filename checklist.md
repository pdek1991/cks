üìù Kubernetes Security & Architecture Mastery Checklist (Printable)


---

1. üîë Cluster Setup & Hardening

[ ] Install Kubernetes clusters (kubeadm, kind, k3s, managed cloud: EKS/GKE/AKS/Openshift).

[ ] Configure RBAC: least privilege roles for users, service accounts, and namespaces.

[ ] Secure kube-apiserver (disable anonymous auth, restrict insecure ports, audit logs enabled).

[ ] Enable etcd encryption at rest and verify.

[ ] Configure Pod Security Standards (PSS) or OPA Gatekeeper/Kyverno.

[ ] Enable TLS everywhere (control plane, etcd, kubelet, ingress).

[ ] Restrict API server access (firewalls, CIDR whitelisting).

[ ] Configure admission controllers (AlwaysPullImages, PodSecurity, NamespaceLifecycle, SecurityContextDeny).

[ ] Benchmark cluster against CIS Kubernetes Benchmark (kube-bench).

[ ] Configure audit policy and send audit logs to Elasticsearch/SIEM.

[ ] Rotate certificates and credentials.

[ ] Configure node hardening (disable unused ports/services, OS patching, SELinux/AppArmor).

[ ] Validate network policies block unauthorized pod-to-pod traffic.



---

2. üîí System Hardening (Linux & Nodes)

[ ] Lock down SSH access to nodes (no root login, key-based auth).

[ ] Apply kernel hardening (seccomp profiles, sysctl tuning).

[ ] Patch and update OS regularly (automated).

[ ] Validate that containers run as non-root users.

[ ] Enforce resource requests/limits (prevent DoS).

[ ] Run CIS Benchmark for Linux nodes.



---

3. üõ°Ô∏è Kubernetes Runtime Security

[ ] Deploy runtime security tools (Falco, Cilium Tetragon, Sysdig Secure).

[ ] Configure PodSecurityContext: runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFilesystem, drop capabilities.

[ ] Block privileged containers.

[ ] Verify hostPath volumes are restricted.

[ ] Apply seccomp and AppArmor profiles.

[ ] Scan images at runtime with Trivy, Aqua, Anchore, Clair.

[ ] Configure eBPF-based runtime monitoring (Cilium, Pixie).

[ ] Enable Container Runtime Interface (CRI) logs and centralize.

[ ] Use GVisor/Kata Containers for sandboxing.

[ ] Implement SELinux enforcing mode in production.



---

4. üê≥ Supply Chain & Image Security

[ ] Use private container registry (Harbor, ECR, GCR, ACR).

[ ] Enforce image signing & verification (cosign, Notary v2, Sigstore).

[ ] Scan images in CI/CD pipeline before pushing.

[ ] Restrict clusters to trusted registries only.

[ ] Enable Admission control with OPA/Kyverno for image policies.

[ ] Configure imagePullSecrets securely.

[ ] Rotate and audit registry credentials.

[ ] Validate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) with Syft/Grype.



---

5. üåê Networking & Traffic Security

[ ] Apply NetworkPolicies (deny-all default, then allow needed).

[ ] Secure Ingress controllers with TLS (Let‚Äôs Encrypt, cert-manager).

[ ] Configure mutual TLS (mTLS) between services (Istio/Linkerd).

[ ] Enforce HTTPS-only for all external endpoints.

[ ] Block traffic from pods to metadata server in cloud clusters.

[ ] Harden DNS policies in cluster.

[ ] Validate service mesh policies (auth, rate limiting, zero trust).

[ ] Test east-west & north-south traffic controls.



---

6. üß© Secrets & Data Security

[ ] Store secrets in Kubernetes Secrets encrypted with KMS (Vault, AWS KMS, GCP KMS).

[ ] Do not store secrets in ConfigMaps or plain manifests.

[ ] Enable etcd encryption for secrets.

[ ] Rotate secrets and keys automatically.

[ ] Integrate HashiCorp Vault/Sealed Secrets/External Secrets Operator.

[ ] Apply RBAC restrictions for secret access.

[ ] Audit secret usage in workloads.



---

7. üìä Monitoring, Logging, and Auditing

[ ] Deploy Prometheus + Grafana for metrics.

[ ] Monitor API server requests & latency.

[ ] Deploy ELK/EFK stack for logs.

[ ] Enable Falco alerts for suspicious activity.

[ ] Forward logs to SIEM (Splunk, Datadog, Elastic Security).

[ ] Configure audit logging and retention policy.

[ ] Track RBAC usage with audit logs.

[ ] Set alerts for suspicious kubectl exec/port-forward events.



---

8. üöÄ CI/CD Security

[ ] Harden CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab).

[ ] Apply **pipeline-level
