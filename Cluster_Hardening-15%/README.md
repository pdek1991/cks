## ðŸ”¹ Cluster Hardening

## ðŸ”¹  Use Role Based Access Controls to minimize exposure

âœ…	Use Role Instead of ClusterRole Whenever Possible
âœ…	Restrict Service Accounts with Least Privilege
âœ…	Disable Auto-Mounting of Service Account Tokens
âœ…	Enforce Read-Only Access for Non-Privileged Users
âœ…	Regularly Audit and Review RBAC Permissions


## ðŸ”¹ Service Account
âœ…	Rotate Service Account Tokens
âœ…	Disable the default service account in namespaces
âœ…	Minimize permissions for new service accounts
âœ…	Audit service account usage regularly
âœ…  SA token is mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/
âœ…  Disable service account automount at service account level and at pod level
âœ…  Use custom service accounts instead of the default one


## ðŸ”¹ Restrict access to Kubernetes API
1 Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to Restrict API Access
2 Restrict API Access with Network Policies (Cluster Network Isolation)
3 Restrict Access with API Server Admission Controllers
4 Enable NodeRestriction (Prevents Pods from Impersonating Other Nodes)
5 Restrict API Access with API Server Authentication and Authorization
6 Disable Anonymous and Unauthorized Access
7 Use Firewall Rules to Restrict API Server Access
8 Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Secure API Communication
9 Disable Service Account Token Auto-Mounting
10 Restrict API Access with Pod Security Policies
11 Monitor API Access with Audit Logging
